# Classify-Radio-Signals-from-Space
A model that helps classify the radio signals using Keras

The data to be used consists of 2D spectrograms of deep space radio signals collected by the Allen Telescope Array at the SETI Institute. 

The spectrograms as images to train an image classification model to classify the signals into one of four classes. 

This project is aimed to build and train a convolutional neural network from scratch using Keras to classify signals from space.
